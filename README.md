| Tech         | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Flutter**   | Frontend and Backend Development |
| **Firebase**    | Authentication, Database and Storage |
| **Gemini**  | AI generated personalised content and insights |

## Medical Misinformation Prevention

BumpToBaby now includes a sophisticated medical misinformation detection system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Qwen. This system helps protect users from potentially harmful medical misinformation by:

1. **PubMed Data Integration**: The app retrieves reliable medical information from PubMed, a trusted source of medical research.

2. **Intelligent Content Moderation**: Using advanced AI technology from Qwen, the app can detect when posts contain medical information that contradicts established medical consensus.

3. **Informative Warnings**: When misinformation is detected, users see clear warning banners explaining the issue along with references to accurate medical information.

4. **Seamless Integration**: The system works alongside our existing content moderation to provide comprehensive protection against both harmful and medically inaccurate content.

### How It Works

1. When a user creates a post, the content is analyzed for medical claims
2. The system searches for relevant medical information in our database
3. If the post contradicts reliable medical information, it's flagged
4. Users see a warning banner with correct information when viewing flagged posts

   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // User profile rules
       match /users/{userId} {
         // Allow read of any user profile
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         // Only allow users to modify their own profile
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
    
       // Posts rules
       match /posts/{postId} {
  		   // Anyone logged in can read posts
  		   allow read: if request.auth != null;

  		   // Only creator can update/delete their posts (excluding likes)
  		   allow update, delete: if request.auth != null
                           && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId
                           && !(request.resource.data.keys().hasAny(['likes']) &&
                                !(request.resource.data.likes == resource.data.likes));

  		   // Allow users to like/unlike by updating only the likes array
  		   allow update: if request.auth != null &&
                   request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['likes']) &&
                   request.resource.data.userId == resource.data.userId;

  		   // Anyone logged in can create posts
  		   allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
      
         // Allow others to update ONLY the commentsCount field
  		   allow update: if request.auth != null &&
                   request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['commentCount']);

  		   allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;

  		   // Comments subcollection (unchanged)
  		   match /comments/{commentId} {
    		   allow read: if request.auth != null;

    		   // Allow comment creation only if userId is set and matches the authenticated user
    		   allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                     request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['userId', 'content']) &&
                     request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

    		   // Allow only comment creator to update/delete their comment
    		   allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  			   }
		   }
    
       // Allow users to read and write their own family planning data
       match /familyPlanning/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
    
       // Allow users to read and write their own health surveys
       match /health_surveys/{userId}/{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
    
       // Allow users to read and write their own health schedules
       match /health_schedules/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
    
       // Default deny
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if false;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Firebase Storage Rules**

## Database Structure

### Firestore Collections

   users/{userId}
   {
     userId: string,
     email: string,
     displayName: string,
     profileImageUrl: string,
     createdAt: timestamp,
     lastLogin: timestamp
   }
   ```

     updatedAt: timestamp,
     likeCount: number,
     commentCount: number,
     likes: {
       userId: boolean
     }
   }
   ```

3. **comments**
   ```
   comments/{commentId}
   {
     commentId: string,
     postId: string,
     userId: string,
     userName: string,
     userProfileImage: string,
     content: string,
     createdAt: timestamp,
     updatedAt: timestamp
   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   - Verify your `google-services.json` and `.env` files are correctly configured
   - Check that your Firebase project has the correct package name
   - Ensure Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage) are enabled

2. **Build Errors**
   - Run `flutter clean` followed by `flutter pub get`
   - Check for any conflicting dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Flutter: `flutter upgrade`

3. **Google Maps Issues**
   - Verify your Google Maps API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Ensure the Google Maps API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console
