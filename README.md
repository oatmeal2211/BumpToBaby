   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       
       match /posts/{postId} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow create: if request.auth != null;
         allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                               resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
       
       match /comments/{commentId} {

       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Firebase Storage Rules**
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /userProfileImages/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       
       match /postImages/{postId}/{allPaths=**} {
         allow read: if request.auth != null;
         allow write: if request.auth != null;
         allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                       firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/posts/$(postId)).data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
     }

## Troubleshooting

1. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   - Verify your `google-services.json` and `.env` files are correctly configured
   - Check that your Firebase project has the correct package name
   - Ensure Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage) are enabled

2. **Build Errors**
   - Run `flutter clean` followed by `flutter pub get`
   - Check for any conflicting dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Flutter: `flutter upgrade`

3. **Google Maps Issues**
   - Verify your Google Maps API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Ensure the Google Maps API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console
